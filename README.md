I enjoy learning about new frameworks to tackle old projects, finding creative & innovative approaches that weren't available or too tedious to implement on a previous iteration. Example: Moving from HTML,CSS & JavaScript to React or from Java & XML to React Native.

Skills: REACT / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Node / MongoDB / SQLite / Java / SQL / C / C++
