[![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=hasanriaz121)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm from Pakistan and mostly work on Software & Web content, currently finishing up on my BSCS from FAST NUCES. I enjoy learning about new frameworks to tackle old projects, finding creative & innovative approaches that weren't available or too tedious to implement on a previous iteration. Moving from HTML,CSS & JavaScript to React or from Java & XML to React Native.

Skills: REACT / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Node / MongoDB / SQLite / Java / SQL / C / C++

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [this](https://github.com/muhidabid/SoftReq).
